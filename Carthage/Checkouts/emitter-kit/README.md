# emitter-kit v4.0.0 [![frozen](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/frozen.svg)](https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index)

&nbsp;

This library provides these 5 major classes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[**Event**](https://github.com/aleclarson/emitter-kit/wiki/Events-&-Signals)
: A type-safe event emitter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[**Signal**](https://github.com/aleclarson/emitter-kit/wiki/Events-&-Signals#signal)
: An event emitter that doesn't pass any data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[**Listener**](https://github.com/aleclarson/emitter-kit/wiki/Event-Listeners)
: An event listener!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[**Notification**](https://github.com/aleclarson/emitter-kit/wiki/Notifications)
: Backwards-compatibility with `NSNotification`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[**Change**](https://github.com/aleclarson/emitter-kit/wiki/Observing-Changes)
: Key-value observation made easy.

### Motivation

`NSNotification` & `NSNotificationCenter` are rather verbose and fail to provide type-safety. This library aims to streamline your work with event emitters & listeners while programming with Swift. It aims to stay as simple as possible without removing powerful features.
